  A ruby is a rare and expensive gem, but Ruby was also the name of my
  grandmother, who instilled in me a passion for life, a love for the wisdom of

  me. And that's what this site is about, seeking and finding rubies.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
