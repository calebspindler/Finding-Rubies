My name is Kayla, and I am a wife, a momma, and a nurse, living it up in San Diego, CA. I believe that as we grow older, we are never to stop seeking out ways in which we might flourish, ways that we might become more truly human.

With that said, my desire for this blog is that it would be an outlet for me to relay the little rubies that I find along this wild journey called life; hence the blog title, “Finding Rubies.” I love the idea of using what the Divine has given us to nourish our bodies and the bodies’ of those we love.

Come along with me on this journey, and you will find recipes, natural living ideas, and much more!
