![Banana ice cream with cinnamon on top sitting on a table.](/img/banana-ice-cream.jpg "Ice cream, peanut butter, and bananas are three of the best things on the earth. How much better when they are together!")

We can all agree there are certain foods that just belong together; cornbread and honey, lime and cilantro, wine and cheese, the list goes on.  One of those perfect combinations for me is PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANAS.  Toss some cinnamon into that mix, and it has to be delicious!  Why I love this recipe:

It’s so creamy and delicious that you wont believe it’s not your typical ice cream.

It’s super simple.

It’s very versatile. 

It has no added sugar.

It has a hint of banana taste, which is a perfect sweet balance to the salty peanut butter.

Enjoy!!

## Ingredients

* 4 ripe bananas, peeled and frozen
* 3/4 cup milk of choice ( I use almond milk)
* 1/3 cup peanut butter (or more to taste)
* 1 tsp cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Peel bananas, break them into pieces, and place them in the freezer for at least 4 hours.
2. Remove bananas from freezer and place in food processor.  Add all other ingredients and blend.  If the mixture is too thick, add more milk.

Should make about 4 servings.
