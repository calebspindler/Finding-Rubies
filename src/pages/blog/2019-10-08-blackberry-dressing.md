We only recently began venturing out into the world of homemade dressings, but this is one we absolutely love!  My husband is allergic to grapes, so store bought dressings are nearly impossible to buy, due to the fact that most of them have balsamic vinegar or some kind of wine based vinegar.  This recipe uses apple cider vinegar which is not my favorite, but I find that the sweetness of the blackberries cuts the harsh acidity of the vinegar.  Sometimes, I put a tiny bit of extra honey in depending on how sweet the dressing is after the blackberries.

This dressing is refreshing, healthy, and is perfect for greens such as arugula or spinach.  I have even drizzled a little on chicken while I grill it and it is delicious!

I would love to hear what salad or other entrees you use it on!
