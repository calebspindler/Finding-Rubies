  There are piles of blog posts about the many essential oil companies existing
  in our world.  The more I researched companies trying to figure out where I
  wanted to buy oils, the more I saw things get HEATED about which company is
  the best.  That is not my goal for this post.  I don’t wish to slam any
  companies or start an internet war; there are other, much better things to
  direct our time toward, right?

My intention for this post is to give you 4 tips to think about as you explore essential oils and find which company is right for you.

## 1. Research the benefits of essential oils by looking at scientific studies AND hearing personal testimonies

Chances are, if you are reading this post, that is just what you are doing.  I was slightly skeptical of essential oils (EO) for a bit because I am trained as a nurse in conventional medicine.  However, the more I read and the more I used them, I realized that they really do have some significant benefits.  Below, I have included some peer reviewed studies in the foot notes.  You can also google “peer reviewed scientific studies on essential oils” and find quite a bit of information.

Essential oil users are on a spectrum.  There are the eccentric people who think that EO cure cancer or keep evil spirits at bay, and there are people who only use EO for scent and to replace candles and other harmful chemicals.  I would say most essential oil users are more on the latter end of the spectrum.  In our home, we use oils to replace toxic cleaning products, boost our immune system, help our toddler sleep, soothe sore muscles, relax us mentally, help with seasonal support, take care of our skin care, make our home smell amazing, and so much more.

Typical cleaning products on store shelves are filled with chemicals that are potential carcinogens, hormone disruptors, and other scary things that could harm you and your family.  Whatever oil company you pick is going to be your gateway into detoxifying your home of harmful toxins.

If you really want to scare yourself, download the free “Think Dirty” app.  You can literally scan every product in your home and see what is in them and how they could be effecting your health and home.

## 2. Buy a good quality oil

Did you know that the FDA doesn’t regulate essential oil sales?  This means that there are fewer regulations and less accountability than for our food and medicine (which could also use a few more regulations).  Technically, for an oil to be labeled a therapeutic essential oil, it only has to contain 5% of the oil it’s labeled as.  This means that companies could fill the rest with a filler oil, alcohol, or even worse, chemicals like hexane or pesticides.   If you are going to fork out some money to get the benefits from essential oils, make sure what the label says matches what is in the bottle.

Furthermore, figure out what is important to you.  I personally want to know that the oil I buy has been sourced at a sustainable farm that is paying good wages to the employees.  Some people desire the label organic, others prefer to buy locally, while others want a company that has been around for a while.  The point is: do your homework when picking oils!

## 3. Buy oils from a company you can trust

As you are looking for an essential oil company to go with, there are a few tidbits to keep in mind.  First of all, there are many bloggers out there who may not be as informed or unbiased as a person would like.  Some can be helpful and be honest with their research and what has worked for them, while others base their ‘research’ on rumors or other people’s opinions.  The best way to get information is directly from the companies website or calling customer service to get your questions answered.  If you aren’t able to get your questions answered with one of those two methods, I would run away.  They either aren’t familiar with what goes into their oils, or don’t necessarily want to answer some of those questions.   I know, this takes effort.  But, it’s worth it to fill your home with safe alternatives!

When perusing websites or speaking with a customer service rep for these companies, here are a few topics/questions you can ask/look for:

* What is in your essential oil?  (Is it pure or are there any fillers?)
* Do you do third party testing?  (Meaning does someone other than the company itself test the products?)
* Do you use sustainable farming methods?
* Do you own your own farms?  If not, what kind of standards do you have when choosing to partner with farmers?
* Do you test each batch?
* Are there pesticides used on the plants that make the oil?

Those are just a few questions to start your journey.  There are certainly more!

## 4. Breathe, and remind yourself that using more natural products is better for you, your family, and the earth.

Exploring essential oils can feel overwhelming, but know that it’s worth the research.  Yes, it will take time to learn how to properly use your oils, but replacing harmful products for you and your family is worth it.

In full disclosure, I chose to go with Young Living essential oils.  However, I know that there are other good companies out there.  Find what is best for you and your family!  For me, I was able to find the information that I wanted from Young Living, and I enjoy the support and community that comes with it.  Also, they have more ‘blends’ and other products besides essential oils such as makeup, skincare, toothpaste, etc.

If, after your research, you do decide on Young Living, let me know and you can [join my team](https://theresolvedcollective.com/join/)!

If not, that’s fine too!  Happy oily journey to you, my friend!
