Mexican food is without a doubt my favorite food group.  There are weeks that we will eat some kind of Mexican-inspired food for every meal, including breakfast!  With lime, cheese, cilantro, tomatoes, some of kind of meat and SPICE how can you ever go wrong?

Tomatillos are delicious; but only after they are cooked or roasted. They are extremely sour when they are raw.   My favorite way to roast them is in a cast iron skillet, but only after you removed their ‘shell’ which is comparable to corn husks but easier to remove and more sticky.

## Three things I love about this recipe:

1. It’s extremely easy
2. The cast iron pan does most of the work for you
3. There are endless combinations of recipes it can go with.  (My favorite is with Cheesy Chorizo Tacos.)

So, without further ado….

## Ingredients

* 6-8 Tomatillos (depending on taste/size
* 1/2 White Onion
* 1 Serrano Pepper
* 4 Garlic Cloves
* 2 Roma Tomatoes (or one Big Boy)
* 2 tsp Sugar (or more to taste)
* 1/2 Lime
* Handful of Cilantro
* Salt and Pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Peel and wash tomatillos.
2. Cut half an onion into two parts to roast.
3. Place tomatillos, roma tomatoes, onion, serrano pepper, and garlic cloves in a heated cast iron pan.  No need for any oil.  Also, don’t remove the shell of the garlic. We will do that after we roast it.
4. Roast everything until the tomatillos are soft.  Yes, you want some things to get ‘blackened’.  It deepens the taste.  Flip everything two or three times to get an even cook, but avoid over-flipping so they get a good sear on them.
5. Once cooked, place all ingredients in a food processor and blend.  For the garlic, if you press a knife in the middle of each clove, the shell will pop right off.
6. Add sugar, lime, cilantro, salt and pepper to taste.
7. Blend again.  Serve warm, but leftovers cold are great as well.
