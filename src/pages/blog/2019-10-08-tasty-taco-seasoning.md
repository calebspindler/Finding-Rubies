![Taco seasoning spices on a plate.](/img/taco-seasoning-recipe.jpg "All you need for some tasty tacos. None of those unpronounceable, mystery ingredients.")

If I haven’t mentioned before, we eat a lot of Mexican food.  Taco seasoning is a must in our weekly grocery list.  And although it’s inexpensive to buy at the store, some of the ingredients on the bag have me thinking “Why does that have to be in there?”.  I get it, you have to add anti-caking agents and preservatives to keep something from going bad on a shelf.  But, if you make the seasoning yourself, you can just have fresh plain spices without eating things that wont necessarily add more flavor to the food.  Best of all, it is easy!

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper
* 1/4 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp black pepper

## Instructions

1. Mix and Enjoy!
2. Use 2 Tablespoons per pound of meat.  (More or less depending on your taste)

Let me know what you think, and if you have a homemade taco seasoning recipe of your own!
