Like any logical person, I am not a fan of germs. Maybe it’s due to the fact that I am in the nursing profession, but I am always thinking about what kinds of ‘crummies’ are on what my family and I are touching and what they could do to us. That being said, when I get to the ‘disinfecting’ part of cleaning, I get really excited. Something about knowing a surface or piece of furniture is rid of bacteria gives me some deep sense of satisfaction.

Unfortunately, many of the cleaners that are so good at taking out bacteria and viruses are also harmful to your health, especially if absorbed through skin or accidentally ingested. With a new baby running around and chewing on anything he can get his hands on, I knew I wanted a cleaner that would get rid of the germs, without leaving harmful chemicals on all of the surfaces he uses as chew toys. I researched and tried a couple of different recipes for a homemade cleaner, tweaked them until I liked it, and have been using it for months now. I absolutely love the way it cleans, and that it rids our home of germs, without covering it with chemicals that I can’t pronounce.

So, here it is! I hope that you love it as much as I have.

# Natural Disinfecting Spray

![A bottle of Young Living Thieves Essential Oil on top of cinnamon sticks.](/img/thieves-cinnamon-sticks.jpg "The star of the show, Thieves Essential Oil is well-known for being a natural disinfectant without the chemicals. Oh, and it smells so good!")

## Ingredients

* 10-15 drops “Thieves” essential oil.  (I use Young Living because I trust this company- read my thoughts on Young Living here)
* 2 Tablespoons Rubbing Alcohol (above 70%)
* 1 cup White Vinegar
* 1 cup boiled or distilled water

## Instructions

1. Gather a spray bottle and some type of funnel. (It’s best to use a spray bottle made from glass, so that the Essential Oils won’t leach anything bad from the plastic.)
2. Combine the Thieves Oil and the Rubbing Alcohol together, and let sit for at least 5 minutes. This step is necessary so that the Essential Oil blends better with the entire bottle and doesn’t just sit on top of the solution. Also, Rubbing Alcohol is another disinfectant!
3. After these two set, combine the vinegar and boiled water (or distilled) to the solution. If using boiled water, let the water cool to room temperature before mixing with the rest of the solution.
4. Give a gentle ‘shake’ to mix ingredients and you are ready to kill some germs!

I would love to hear from you and your thoughts on this product! Happy Cleaning!
